This is a simple challenge where I used the shell provided by them and used these commands.

Folder name was revving_up. It consisted 2 files flag.txt,revving_up

 $ cd revving_up;
 $ cat flag.txt --> I had no permission to view the flag.txt
 $ ls -l        --> I got to know that I had executable permissin for revving_up
 $ file revving_up  --> I got to know it was executable
 $ strings revving_up  --> To get better understanding of the printable character,
                           I did this and got some info of how to provide input.
 $ ./revving_up     --> just follwed this and got the flag.
